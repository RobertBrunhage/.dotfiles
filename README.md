# STOW (Linux and Mac)

Clone this repo to either your Home directory or anywhere else

## Stow
stow {folder} -t ~

`setup.sh` is all I use ðŸ™ƒ

## Out of context
I did write a small wiki for myself when I used Windows which I probably should add more details too

## Disclaimer
Hey either future self or some nerd

I used this before on both Windows and Linux but I would assume they are borken by now.
